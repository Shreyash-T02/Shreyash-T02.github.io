Hi, I’m Shreyash Thorat, from Mumbai, India. I completed my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering and have developed a strong foundation of robotics, manufacturing  and hands on problem-solving through various projects.

This fall, I’m beginning my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at USC, where I aim to further explore robotics and advanced system design, building on my foundation in mechanical systems and engineering principles.

I’m someone who loves building projects and geeking out over new ideas, but I also know how to balance hard work with having a good time. Outside of engineering, I’m passionate about traveling and staying active through table tennis, basketball, swimming, and volleyball though I’m always up for trying something new and fun. A big fan of spontaneous plans, relaxed hangouts, or a fresh challenge, I enjoy making the most of every day.
